# 22 Modern UI - A Python APP GUI

## 22 Modern UI - A Python App GUI For QT, PyQt, PySide Desktop App | Custom Widgets Module Tutorial

This is a Python App GUI presented in the tutorial at:

- Creator and Developer: Spinn TV.
- Link: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adC48qZ8p5Y> .

## Objective

I followed this tutorial so that I could adquire some knowledge about QT Designer and start my own App in the near future.

I noted that the QT Design project and the codes in VSCode are easy to modify, and I liked a lot the final result of the interface, so I'm going to use as my layout base for my personal project.
